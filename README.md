# Project Description
**AUDIOBOOK IN PYTHON**
An automated system is developed of an audiobook named, ‘Audio-da-city’. The web page will provide the users a space to exercise for all kinds of audio-listening tools.
The customers can create an account with details like name, phone number and email address. The user can then log in using their username and password. The home page contains access to options like slide book, e-book, pronunciation book and a talking dictionary. Slide book and e-book facilitate listening to a book with user-friendly commands of play, pause, resume and stop. The assistant's voice can also be selected to be male or female. A full narrative experience of e-book can be accomplished by writing reviews using sticker notes for self-collection.
